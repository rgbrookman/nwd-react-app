        Thich Nhat Hanh
        </h3>
        <p className="resource description">Buddhism has hugely effectively, in my opinion, synthesised the human relationship to pain and the transformation of pain - not with science and scientific tools - but with 
                    thought, observation and story telling over thousands of years. Thich Nhat Hanh was a pioneer that continued this tradition by being able to communicate the teachings to new audiences. 
                    His version of the Buddhas teaching is very accessible and thought provoking.

        <p className="resource description">I have been thoroughly grateful to Tim Ferriss ever since I stumbled across his podcast and the 4 Hour Work Week almost a decade ago. It has served me very well as an antidote to some of the vicarious learnings of modern life - 9 to 5 drudgery, mortgages etc - and as an example of how to open with your pain and share it with the world so other people can do the same.
