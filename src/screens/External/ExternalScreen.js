        Thich Nhat Hanh
        </h3>
        <p className="resource description">Buddhism has hugely effectively, in my opinion, synthesised the human relationship to pain and the transformation of pain - not with science and scientific tools - but with 
                    thought, observation and story telling over thousands of years. Thich Nhat Hanh was a pioneer that continued this tradition by being able to communicate the teachings to new audiences. 
                    His version of the Buddhas teaching is very accessible and thought provoking.
